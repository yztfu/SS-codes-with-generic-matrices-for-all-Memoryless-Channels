# SS-codes-with-generic-matrices-for-all-Memoryless-Channels
This is a repository of the code of SS-codes-with-generic-rotational-invariant-coding-matrices-for-all-Memoryless-Channels. Here is the relevant code written in python generated by the figure data of the paper "Sparse superposition codes with generic rotational invariant coding matrices for all Memoryless Channels".

The python file [gamp.py](https://github.com/yztfu/SS-codes-with-generic-matrices-for-all-Memoryless-Channels/blob/main/simulation_general_noise/gamp.py) and [goamp.py](https://github.com/yztfu/SS-codes-with-generic-matrices-for-all-Memoryless-Channels/blob/main/simulation_and_se/goamp.py) are the simulation of AMP and VAMP algorithm respectively.
